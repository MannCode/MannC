=======================================================


====== Instruction Format ======

* First short is opcode (0xXX %XXXXXXYY) - X is instruction | and Y is its instances
* Seccond short is the address or data
* If opcode takes nothing :-
    * No extra short needed

==== How instruction is written ====

* if instruction takes nothing
    * [space/tab]+Instruction
* if instruction takes data/address
    * [space/tab]+Instruction+[Space]+[if imidiate]+[value]
        * example - LDA ($0000, X)

^ Instruction - It defines the 0xXXXX in the opcode (1st short)
^ if imidiate - It defines the opcode takes data or address (denoted by "#" or "")
^ [value] - It defines the YY in the opcode and the value of data/address (2 and 3 byte) according to the instruction
    * all the value types are:
        * if imidiate is "" :
            1. ""
            3. address
            4. [address, registor]
            5. [address], register
        * if imidiate is "#" :
            1. data

========= Simple rules for Assembler =======

* Written in text files
* One instruction per line


======= Lables =======

* Lable starts with ":" a colon
* lable dont have a [space/tab] in the starting

======= Variables ========

* variable is just a address to the memory location in which value is stored
* assign varialbes
    * auto assigned variables
        * .[name]
        * example - .xpos
        * assembler will assign variables address automatically
    * variables with custom address/imm16
        * [name] + [space] + "=" + [space] + [address/imm16]
        * example - .multipled = 3000

* if want to use the variable as address
    * [instruction] [name of variable]
    * example - STA xpos

* if want to use the variable as imm16
    * [instruction] #([name of varialble])
    * example - LDA #(xpos)

===== Comment =====

* only support single line comment now
* comment starts with ";" a semicolon
* comment can start after a instruction also and in a seperate line also


====== number base types ======

$ - Hexadecimal number
^ - binary number
"" - decimal number

====== Operators =====

* if data/address is in "()" parantaces then we can have operators inside them

* some operators are :-
    +,-,*,/

======= .org ======

* To start a next part of code starting from a perticualar address :-
    - we use (  ` [address])

====== assign direct short to a location ========
* use ( : [byte])


== @macros ==
* syntax - @macro_name macro_arguments

* defining @macros - 

    ~macro_name numberof_arguments {
        // macro code here    
    }

* including @macro from another code - #include "filename_with_path"
* arguments will be used like numbers - %1, %2, %3
